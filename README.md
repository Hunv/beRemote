# beRemote
OpenSource Management Software

beRemote is a .Net/C# Remote Desktop Management System.
More protocols can be added an easy way.

Currently Supported protocols are:
RDP (Full)
VNC (Raw only)
Telnet/SSH (not fully implemented)
Browser (IE and Chrome)


The project is currently not perfect. There are some things that should be optimized, but it is released anyway.
